    latlng: The latitude and longitude values specifying the location for which you wish to obtain the closest, human-readable address.
        location_type: A filter of one or more location types, separated by a pipe (|). If the parameter contains multiple location types, the API returns all addresses that match any of the types. A note about processing: The location_type parameter does not restrict the search to the specified location type(s). Rather, the location_type acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the specified latlng, then discards those results that do not match the specified location type(s). Note: This parameter is available only for requests that include an API key or a client ID. A list of supported types can be found in the API Overview.

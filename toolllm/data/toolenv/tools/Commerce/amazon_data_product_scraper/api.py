    "A product detail page is where a customer discovers a unique product sold on Amazon. It can include one or more offers from sellers or from Amazon.
		
		This page is a shared space that displays attributes that are common to all offers for the product, such as the following:
		
		Title
		Image
		Bullet points
		Description
		Product variations (such as size or colour)
		Customer reviews
		Some categories have additional product detail attributes. For example in Electronics, cameras have attributes such as optical zoom and max resolution that would not be required for other product categories.
		
		You and other sellers can list an offer on a product detail page. You create and control your own offer for a product, including price, shipping options, condition and other attributes. If a product does not exist on Amazon, you can create an offer for it and Amazon will create a new product detail page. Amazon chooses what information to include on the product detail page based on manufacturer and seller contributions."

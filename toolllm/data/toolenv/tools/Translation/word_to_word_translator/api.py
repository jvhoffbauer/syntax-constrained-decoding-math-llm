    "`translate` is the core API of our service.
		
		Note that `translate` is not suited for sentences or longer texts. There are way better services for that (like Google translation API etc)'. Also note that: 
		
		> This is to be used as *a multilingual search engine or depending on your wishes, other natural language processing purposes and not for mere translation*.
		
		Although you can do so, because translation is the core of this, **it is very very approximate**.
		
		A `cat` might be translated to other contextual terms in other languages as: `["animal", "mammal", "domestic"]`. This approximate translation is in fact blazingly fast, and paradoxically more suited for search engines.
		
		Finally, You maybe guessed that `target` can be an array, indeed, and the form to provide multiple targets is simply adding multiple `target` parameters.
		
		Like the following:
		
		```
		 curl --get -G 'https://YourWord2WordTranslator@RapidAPI/api/translate?' 
		              -d word=science 
		              -d target=en

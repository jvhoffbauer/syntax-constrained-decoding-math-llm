		API Endpoint
		
		The API has a single endpoint for checking password strength:

		The API expects a JSON object with a password field in the request body. The response will contain a success field indicating if the request was successful, a message field indicating the password strength, and a HTTP status code."
    checkpassword: This is a Node.js application that uses the Express framework and the body-parser middleware to create an API endpoint that checks the strength of a password. The endpoint accepts a POST request to "/checkPassword", with a JSON payload that contains a "password" field. The endpoint checks the password against a set of criteria and returns a response indicating the strength of the password. The response includes a success status, a message indicating the password strength, and an HTTP status code. The application listens on a specified port and logs a message to the console when it starts.

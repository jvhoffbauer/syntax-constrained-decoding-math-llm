        height: Label height.
        code: It is a string that represents **average** label sizes, in the format [width]x[height].
For example:
**2.5x4**
or 
**70x40**

Being average sizes, means that they represent all sizes that are close to them. 
E.g. **3x2** would represent any other close sizes like **3.062x1.837**.

This concept is useful, when you are going to suggest to your users, which templates do offer label sizes that are equal of close to the label size they need to print on.

        width: Label width
        shape: Label shape.
Valid values are:
square

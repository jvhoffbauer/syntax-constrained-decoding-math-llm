    "The Forecastica stock forecasts API utilizes our proprietary machine learning and neural network algorithm to generate 30 day stock forecasts for roughly 200,000 stock symbols  that belong to 73 of the most well-known exchanges in the world that span the United States (around 15,000 symbols in total for NYSE, NASDAQ), Europe and Asia.  Each forecast includes open, close, low and high stock prices.   In addition, each forecast include a fap value which is the average of the open, close, low and high price and the fapPct which is a percentage value that represents a predicted percentage change in the predicted stock price from the day before to the next day.   In addition, each forecasting day includes a buy, hold and sell trading signal that is based on our proprietary machine learning trading algorithm.  Our trading signal is based on mathematically predicted turning points (relative minimum or maximum value of stock quotes vs. time)
		
		Our proprietary model is based on machine learning and neural networks. Simply put, our stock forecasts are driven by pattern recognition that enables the model to identify stock-purchasing trends. It then provides an objective recommendation on what action to take with any given stock!
		
		Our software will help you to hear the pulse of the stock market and get recommendations for the best BUY/SELL/HOLD moments!
		
		If you get zero results for the given stock symbol use the /exchanges/{EXCHANGE-SYMBOL}/stocks API to lookup the symbol for the given exchange because the symbol may have changed over time as a result you will need to use the most up to date symbol for the company."

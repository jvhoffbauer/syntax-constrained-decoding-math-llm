They are a set of modified Western Electric rules, developed by James Westgard and provided in his books and seminars on quality control."

The Western Electric rules were codified by a specially-appointed committee of the manufacturing division of the Western Electric Company and appeared in the first edition of a 1956 handbook, that became a standard text of the field.[2] Their purpose was to ensure that line workers and engineers interpret control charts in a uniform way."

The control chart is used to determine if the rate of nonconforming product is stable and detect when a deviation from stability has occurred. The argument can be made that a LCL should not exist, since rates of nonconforming product outside the LCL is in fact a good thing; we WANT low rates of nonconforming product. However, if we treat these LCL violations as simply another search for an assignable cause, we may learn for the drop in nonconformities rate and be able to permanently improve the process."

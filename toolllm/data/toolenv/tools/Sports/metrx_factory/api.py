    "Returns the history of a team's performance index. Each datapoint represents an index change based on a match performance. The indication of projections controls which data should be collected and has direct impact on the payload and billed credits.
		
		There is one obligatory parameter which identifies the team of the trend. If no more parameters are provided then the trend for the last year's performance (*Basic* subscriptions: one month) is returned with only the main index projection in absolute index format. For details about index calculation and factors refer to the documentation.
		
		For free subscriptions the following limits apply:
		
		`Max. requests per hour: 20`
		`Min. time between requests: 1 minute`
		`Max. time span returned: 1 month`"
    teamid: The identifier of the team for which the performances should be collected. Use the `Get Teams` operation to find valid identifiers.
        estimatebill: Flag whether a cost estimate should be returned for the above parameters instead of the result.
**Default**: false
        projection: A single projection applied when building the result (case-insensitive).
**Allowed**: `I` Main index, `VI` Venue index, `IT` Index trend, `LIC` Last index change, `LMD` Last match details
**Default**: I

Refer to [API reference](https://docs.metrxfactory.io/#team-pfm-idx-proj-enum) for further details.
        mindate: The lower bound of the history's time span (inclusive).
**Pattern**: `yyyy-MM-dd['T'HH:mm]`
        maxdate: The upper bound of the history's time span (inclusive).
**Pattern**: `yyyy-MM-dd['T'HH:mm]`
        timezone: The time zone used to interpret the `minDate` and `maxDate` parameters.
**Default**: UTC
        projections: Alternative to the `projection` parameter. A comma-separated list of projections applied when building the result (case-insensitive).
        format: The format applied to index values (case-insensitive).
**Allowed**: `ABS` Absolute, `REL` Relative.
**Default**: ABS
BASIC subscriptions support only `ABS`.

		You will see that it calculates Nicole Poturalski as his best overall (sort='O')  general match.
		
		If you change the input parameters and specify sort='P' (Physical), you will see that she is also currrently (20220 his best physical (sex) match.
		
		If you wish to see how it sorts his Intellectual matches, change this to sort='I', and you will see that Jennifer Aniston is currently her best intellectual partner.
		
		For interest, change the ryr parameter to '2004' using the sortorder = 'L'ove setting, you'll see how Jennifer was at the top of the love list, i.e.

		You'll see Angeline Jolie is second from the bottom, with a negative overall rating.
		
		Negative ratings indicate that there are bad aspects in operation and this person should be avoided. In 2015 Brad and Angelina divorced.
		
		But there is some good news for him and his family. If you look ahead to the year 2030 by changing the ryr parameter to 2030, you will see he has a strong love relationship with Angelina Jolie again, and Jennifer Aniston has faded away in his life.

    "Intended usage is as a one liner. For example like this:
		backup.sh && curl https://simple-email-notifications.p.rapidapi.com/Backup finished âœ… /?email=demo@example.com&rapidapi-key=<your-rapidapi-key>
		
		We recommend to use your rapidapi key as a query parameter as to reduce the complexity of the curl call.
		
		Send a email notification to the specified recipient. Note that it's not possible to set a email body. It's only possible to set a subject, as this API is only supposed to be used as a notification tool for jobs or tasks that have finished or experienced errors. If you don't set a subject, "ðŸ“©" will be set automatically for you."
    email: The E-Mail address that should receive this notification. Please note that it is NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS API TO SEND ANY KIND OF MARKETING E-MAILS OR ANY E-MAIL COMMUNICATION WITH PARTIES THAT HAVE NOT GIVEN THEIR CONSENT TO RECEIVE THOSE E-MAILS! 
        subject: The subject to set for the E-Mail. In case you don't set a subject \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ðŸ“©\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will be set for you. The maximum allowed length is 50 characters.

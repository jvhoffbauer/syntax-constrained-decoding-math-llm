    "## Two ways to use this endpoint:
		1. Search by category, language, reading level, section, title, author, or any combination of these filters. This will give you a list of books to discover, along with metadata, a cover image for each book, and the book's NID number.
		
		2. Use the NID of a book (with no other parameters) to get the content pages of the book, along with its metadata and cover image. This will only work for a single NID at a time. This is counted as a "read" and counts toward your quota. **Important: You must send us your watermark in order to access this content. More information below.**
		
		## Required: Your watermark
		Before you can see the contents of our books, you must send us an image we can use to watermark each page (usually your company's logo). We do this to protect our content creators. Please send your watermark in .png format to apisupport@magicblox.com. Images should be no more than 100 pixels high and no more than 200 pixels wide and should have a transparent background."
    seed: Specify a seed (between 1 and1000000) to randomize your results. Results randomized in this way will always return in the same order, so you can paginate (see limit and offset) a randomly ordered set of results without seeing the same book twice or missing a book.
        reading_level: Returns a specified books section.

**Possible values:**
- 'Beginner (1 to 6)'
- 'Intermediate (6 to 9)'
- 'Advanced (9 to 13)'
        offset: Sets to offset of the books returned. Use this in collaboration with the 'limit' parameter to implement pagination.

For example, if your search results in 100 books, you could retrieve all of them by specifying a limit of 20 and making five queries with offsets 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80.
        nid: Use the NID of a book (with no other parameters) to get the content pages of the book, along with its metadata and cover image. This will only work for a single NID at a time. This is counted as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and counts toward your quota. **Important: You must send us your watermark in order to access this content.

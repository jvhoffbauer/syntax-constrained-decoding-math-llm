    "Input a valid aircraft ICAO Code ( e.g. **A320**) and a valid Route String. The Route string must contain a valid Origin Airport ICAO Code ( e.g. **KJFK**), at least one waypoint ( e.g. **WAVEY**), and a valid Destination Airport ICAO Code ( e.g. **MKJP**). The origin and destination airport codes must be distinct. Once a request is made, a line will be drawn starting from the origin airport, moving along each waypoint, and then terminating at the destination airport. During this time, the FIR intersections will be calculated. Using Aircraft information, the distance, time, fuel, FIR traversal, and CO2 emissions will be calculated for the climb, cruise, and descent of the flight. 
		Example Route String: **KJFK..WAVEY..EMJAY.J174.DIW..DIZNY.AR3.ZQA.Y307.ENAMO..NEFTU.UP525.EMABU.UA301.IMADI..SAVEM..MKJP**
		
		The response will produce a set of features containing information about each FIR that has been intersected. Additionally, the response will produce data related to the climb (**climbData**) and descent (**descentData**) of the aircraft. 
		Each feature will contain:

		- The country name ( e.g. **United States**)
		- Distance in km and nm ( e.g. **415.3 km** / **224.2 nm**)
		- Cruise Time in minutes ( e.g. **22**)
		- Fuel consumption in kilograms ( e.g. **797.48**)
		- A numerical sequence number along the route ( e.g. **1**)
		- The geographic coordinates of the line segment  in [longitude, latitude] format ( e.g. **[ -73.78, 40.64], [-73.57, 40.42]** )
		
		The Climb Data will contain:
		- Fuel used during the climb in kilograms ( e.g. **2937**)
		- CO2 emissions used during the climb in kilograms ( e.g. **9279**)
		- Distance of the climb in km and nm (nautical miles) ( e.g. **624 km** / **337 nm**)
		- Time of the climb in minutes ( e.g. **65**)
		- The FIR in which the climb occurred ( e.g. **KZDC**)
		
		The Descent Data will contain:
		- Fuel used during the descent in kilograms ( e.g. **74**)
		- CO2 emissions used during the descent in kilograms ( e.g. **233**)
		- Distance of the descent in km and nm (nautical miles) ( e.g. **126 km** / **68 nm**)
		- Time of the descent in minutes ( e.g. **14**)
		- The FIR in which the descent occurred ( e.g. **MKJK**)
		- The FIR in which the cruise finished and the descent began ( e.g. **MUFH**)"

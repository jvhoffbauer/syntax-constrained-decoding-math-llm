    "Generic getter for listings supporting a wide array of selection criteria. This is the new primary listing endpoint and we will phase out the older listing endpoints over time. The other listing endpoints return the same data, but are more restrictive in the available geographic and vehicle selection criteria and can be replicated by this endpoint.
		
		Dealer selection uses the most restrictive criteria supplied. From most restrictive to least: dealerID, gps, zipCode, region. You must provide some dealer selection criteria.
		
		It is important to note that the units in the longitude are in degrees east, not degrees west. For example the coordinates 45.53N, 100.41W correspond to Mobridge, SC but they will be interpreted as 45.53N, 100.41E which corresponds to a point in the Gobi Desert near Jinst, Mongolia. You can fix this by converting the longitiude yourself, or by supplying a negative value (-100.41). For this example both (X, -100.41) and (X, 259.59) would be the same point. Units on the radius are miles and a smaller radius will result in a faster response time. Maximum search radius depends on your subscription plan. The radius value is only used for GPS searches and is ignored for searches using other location criteria.
		
		Listing selection logically ANDs all options given.
		
		Time interval selection will prefer explicit start and end dates. If only one of startDate/endDate is supplied, this endpoint will use it as an anchor and look forward or backwards by the daysBack value. If startDate is specified and endDate is not, then endDate will be set to startDate+daysBack. Conversely if endDate is specified, but startDate is not then startDate will be set at endDate-daysBack. If neither is supplied endpoint will set endDate to today and startDate to today-daysBack. This endpoint is restricted to listings from the last 90 days on RapidAPI.
		
		Maximum time interval is 45 days.
		
		Mileage selection uses the provided mileage values and returns vehicles with mileage in the range [mileageLow, mileageHigh]. If mileageLow == mileageHigh (for example both are 0 default) this endpoint will not filter based on mileage. Not all used vehicles have a mileage record available.
		
		ExtendedSearch modifies the slice of listings returned. If false (default) it only returns vehicles satisfying lastSeen >= startDate and lastSeen < endDate. If true it will return vehicles that were in dealer's inventory at any point between startDate and endDate including vehicles that were sold after endDate. Setting extendedSearch to true will result in a slower response time.
		
		For example: If both a region name and dealer ID are supplied the dealer ID will be used because it is the most restrictive.
		
		If a brandName of Ford and modelYear of 2019, modelName of F-150, and newCars of False is supplied this endpoint will return used 2019 model year Ford F-150s. If a contradictory listing selection is supplied (for example Ford + Camry) no listings will be returned because the request matched no listings.
		
		Results are paginated in chunks of up to 20 vehicles. Prices are in the dealer's local currency (generally USD)."

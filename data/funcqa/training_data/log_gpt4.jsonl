{"question": "If a number is divided by 4 and the result is 123, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/4 = 123, to find x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 123 * 4 = 492<eoe>492."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 3 and the result is 789, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/3 = 789, to find x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 789 * 3 = 2367<eoe>2367."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 5 and the result is 1054, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/5 = 1054, to find x, we multiply both sides by 5: x = 1054 * 5 = 5270<eoe>5270."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 6 and the result is 2048, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/6 = 2048, to find x, we multiply both sides by 6: x = 2048 * 6 = 12288<eoe>12288."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 7 and the result is 350, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/7 = 350, to find x, we multiply both sides by 7: x = 350 * 7 = 2450<eoe>2450."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 8 and the result is 512, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/8 = 512, to find x, we multiply both sides by 8: x = 512 * 8 = 4096<eoe>4096."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 4 and the result is 625, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/4 = 625, to find x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 625 * 4 = 2500<eoe>2500."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 9 and the result is 567, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/9 = 567, to find x, we multiply both sides by 9: x = 567 * 9 = 5103<eoe>5103."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 5 and the result is 1024, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/5 = 1024, to find x, we multiply both sides by 5: x = 1024 * 5 = 5120<eoe>5120."}
{"question": "If a number is divided by 6 and the result is 300, what is the original number?", "answer": "Let the original number be x. Given that x/6 = 300, to find x, we multiply both sides by 6: x = 300 * 6 = 1800<eoe>1800."}

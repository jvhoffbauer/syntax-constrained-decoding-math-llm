{"question": "If it takes 5 minutes to boil one egg, how many minutes will it take to boil 24 eggs assuming you can only boil one egg at a time?", "answer": "It takes 5 minutes to boil one egg, so to boil 24 eggs, it will take 5*24=<multiply>(5, 24)=120<eoe>120 minutes."}
{"question": "If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h and needs to cover a distance of 360 km, how many hours will it take?", "answer": "To find out how long it will take, we divide the distance by the speed. Therefore, 360 km divided by 60 km/h is 360/60=<multiply>(360, 60)=6<eoe>6 hours."}
{"question": "A factory produces 250 bicycles in a day. If they need to produce 5000 bicycles, how many days will it take?", "answer": "To find out how many days it will take, we divide the total number of bicycles needed by the number of bicycles produced in a day. Therefore, 5000 bicycles divided by 250 bicycles/day is 5000/250=<multiply>(5000, 250)=20<eoe>20 days."}
{"question": "If a painter can paint a room in 6 hours, how many rooms can they paint in 72 hours assuming they work at the same pace?", "answer": "To find out how many rooms the painter can paint in 72 hours, we divide the total hours by the hours it takes to paint one room. Therefore, 72 hours divided by 6 hours/room is 72/6=<multiply>(72, 6)=12<eoe>12 rooms."}
{"question": "A chef needs to prepare 120 cupcakes for a party, and each batch of cupcakes requires 30 minutes to bake. If the chef can bake 3 batches at the same time, how many minutes will it take to bake all the cupcakes?", "answer": "To find out how many minutes it will take to bake all the cupcakes, first, we calculate the total number of batches needed by dividing the total cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in a batch. Assuming each batch makes 40 cupcakes, we have 120 cupcakes divided by 40 cupcakes/batch = 120/40 = <multiply>(120, 40) = 3 batches. Since the chef can bake 3 batches at the same time, it will take only one round of baking. Therefore, it will take 30 minutes to bake all the cupcakes."}
{"question": "If a person reads 20 pages of a book each day, how many days will it take them to read a book of 400 pages?", "answer": "To find out how many days it will take, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages read each day. Therefore, 400 pages divided by 20 pages/day is 400/20=<multiply>(400, 20)=20<eoe>20 days."}
{"question": "If a person walks at a speed of 5 km/h and wants to complete a walk of 25 km, how many hours will it take?", "answer": "To find out how long it will take, we divide the distance by the speed. Therefore, 25 km divided by 5 km/h is 25/5=<multiply>(25, 5)=5<eoe>5 hours."}
{"question": "A car travels at a speed of 60 km/h. How many hours will it take to travel a distance of 360 km?", "answer": "To find out how long it will take, we divide the distance by the speed. Therefore, 360 km divided by 60 km/h is 360/60=<multiply>(360, 60)=6<eoe>6 hours."}
{"question": "If a factory produces 240 toys in 8 hours, how many toys can it produce in 32 hours assuming it works at the same pace?", "answer": "To find out how many toys the factory can produce in 32 hours, we divide the total hours by the hours it takes to produce the given number of toys. Therefore, 32 hours divided by 8 hours/toy is 32/8=<multiply>(32, 8)=960 toys."}
{"question": "If a cyclist travels at a speed of 15 km/h and wants to complete a distance of 45 km, how many hours will it take?", "answer": "To find out how long it will take, we divide the distance by the speed. Therefore, 45 km divided by 15 km/h is 45/15=<multiply>(45, 15)=3<eoe>3 hours."}

{"question": "What is the cube of 4?", "answer": "The cube of 4 is 4^3=<power>(4, 3)=64<eoe>64."}
{"question": "How many times smaller is the volume of a cube with edge length 2 meters compared to a cube with edge length 8 meters?", "answer": "The volume of a cube is given by the edge length cubed. So, the volume of the first cube is 2^3=<power>(2, 3)=8 cubic meters, and the volume of the second cube is 8^3=<power>(8, 3)=512 cubic meters. The volume of the larger cube is 512/8=64 times larger than that of the smaller cube, so the smaller cube's volume is 1/64=<power>(64, -1)=0.015625 times that of the larger cube.<eoe>0.015625."}
{"question": "If the speed of light is 299,792 kilometers per second, how many kilometers does light travel in 3 seconds?", "answer": "The distance light travels in 3 seconds is calculated by multiplying the speed of light by the time. So, the distance is 299,792 * 3 = <power>(299792, 1)*3=899,376 kilometers.<eoe>899,376 kilometers."}
{"question": "What is the result of dividing 1 by the square of 5?", "answer": "The result of dividing 1 by the square of 5 is 1/(5^2)=<power>(5, -2)=0.04.<eoe>0.04."}
{"question": "What is the square root of 16?", "answer": "The square root of 16 is given by 16^(1/2)=<power>(16, 0.5)=4.<eoe>4."}
{"question": "What is the result of dividing 2 by the cube of 4?", "answer": "The result of dividing 2 by the cube of 4 is 2/(4^3)=<power>(4, -3)=0.03125.<eoe>0.03125."}
{"question": "What is the cube root of 27?", "answer": "The cube root of 27 is given by 27^(1/3)=<power>(27, 0.3333333333333333)=3.<eoe>3."}
{"question": "What is the result of multiplying 8 by the square of 9?", "answer": "The result of multiplying 8 by the square of 9 is 8 * (9^2)=<power>(9, 2)*8=648.<eoe>648."}
{"question": "What is the result of dividing 10 by the square of 2?", "answer": "The result of dividing 10 by the square of 2 is 10/(2^2)=<power>(2, -2)*10=2.5.<eoe>2.5."}
{"question": "What is the result of dividing 12 by the square of 3?", "answer": "The result of dividing 12 by the square of 3 is 12/(3^2)=<power>(3, -2)*12=1.3333333333333333.<eoe>1.3333333333333333."}
